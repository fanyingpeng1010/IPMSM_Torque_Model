# IPMSM_Torque_Model
Aiming at the limitation of the traditional torque calculation method based on the current-flux vector product, which is difficult to accurately characterise the motor torque ripples in one electrical cycle, this IPMSM torque analytical model has been developed to provide an IPMSM torque calculation method that comprehensively takes into account the factors of magnetic saturation, spatial harmonics, and iron losses. The model is divided into two parts: an analytical model without iron loss considerations and an analytical model with iron loss considerations. The calculation results of the model were compared with the FEA results with three typical working conditions (low-speed light load, low-speed heavy load and high-speed light load) to verify the validity of the model.
